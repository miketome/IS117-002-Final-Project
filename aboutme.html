  <h1>Michael's Bio</h1>
  
  <p> Michael is a student attending the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, NJ.  He is an IT major specializing in network and information security.  He built this websiet for his IS Web Development class with Professor
  Arthur Hendela.  He is a member of the NJIT Esports Valorant D1 team (what a nerd!).  He is also very passionate about cars! His passion started when he landed his first real job as a lot coordinator at an Audi dealership. After spending countless hours there driving
all different types of cars his passion slowly grew over time.  Cars have slowly transformed into one of his favorite things to talk about and driving is one of his favorite activities to do when he needs to de-stress or just kill some free time.  He even went out of his way to
teach himself how to drive manual transmission, so that he could get his next dream car, a Ford Focus ST. Now michael just cant shut up about how much he loves his car, and he cant wait for his next paycheck to land in his back account so he can blow it all on gas and car parts.
Aside from cars Michael has been passionate about computers ever since he was a small child.  His dad always had computers in the house and his family was big on technology.  He had his first real computer in his room when he was in 6th grade.  A couple years went by before he asked his parents for a gaming computer in 9th grade.
from then on he was hooked on the digital world.  Always looking for fun games to play and things to do with his friends on the computer.  This passion followed him through highschool where he joined his schools student IT club.
Their task was to assist the IT department in helping teachers learn about the new laptops the school was providing everyone with and to teach them different programs and tools to make their class more tech-oriented.  
This ignited his passion for IT even more and drove him to apply to NJIT where he currently attends.  He is set to graduate in the fall of 2021 and is extremely excited for what the future holds for him.
